- Ben van Werkhoven, on behalf of the Council

The International Council of RSE Associations is happy to endorse RSE 
conferences and similar events. The Council will list and promote endorsed 
events on its website and other communication channels, and encourage its 
members to promote these events to their membership. In turn, the event 
organizers are expected to mention the endorsement on their websites and 
communication.

<!--break-->

The following are required for endorsement by the Council:

* The event should be clearly RSE branded, e.g. through organisation by a 
national RSE association, or a clear thematic focus.
* The event should be open to all. Reasonable fees can be charged for 
participation.
* The event should be publicly advertised online and a link provided for 
inclusion on the Council website, and ideally published via public calendar 
for inclusion in the Council programme of events.
* The event should have a Code of Conduct. Event organizers are welcome to 
adopt the Council’s Code of Conduct if they don’t have their own.

If you would like the International Council of RSE Associations to endorse 
your event, please contact [the council](mailto:intl-rse-council@listserv.dfn.de).

We would appreciate it if talks were recorded and made publicly available 
after the event. Ideally, all video recordings should have captioning and 
subtitles translated to English (automated translation). We are happy to 
include links to the recordings on the Council’s website.
