The International Council of RSE Associations has decided to declare the second Thursday 
in October to be "International RSE Day". The first annual International RSE Day will be 
Thursday, 14th October 2021.

<!--break-->

The International RSE Day is to celebrate Research Software Engineers around the world 
and raise awareness for the increasingly relevant discipline of Research Software 
Engineering. The International Council encourages national and local RSE associations to 
hold regular or special events on this day, such as:

* Keynote talks
* Networking events
* National meetups, possibly in combination with the annual AGM
* Awareness campaigns
* National RSE information sessions

The Council is happy to list and advertise International RSE Day events on its website.
