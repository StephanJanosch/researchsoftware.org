# Contributing to the pages of the International Council of RSE Associations

Contributions to these pages should be made by Council representatives only.

If you're a new representative and need to update representative information, please ask another member for access to the shared folder. This folder contains a document called "Onboarding for new Council members", which contains all the necessary information to gain access.
